# Boutiqa Marketplace Prototype

## Project Overview

Boutiqa is a cutting-edge marketplace designed to offer an exceptional user experience while building strong relationships between sellers and consumers. Developed as part of my work at Brightica Design Agency, the project focuses on creating a user-friendly platform for vendors to showcase and sell their products effortlessly, and for buyers to navigate and shop with ease.

The prototype serves as a blueprint to achieve Boutiqa's mission: providing a seamless and engaging online experience tailored to meet the diverse needs of both sellers and buyers.
